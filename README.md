**Overview**

"Aroung The US" project is an interactive page where users can add, remove, or like photos. This is my first time using JavaScript (functions, if statements, QuerySelectors, addEventListener).
I also used HTML and CSS (flexbox, grid, mediaQueries)to build and style responsive web page.
